# Alz_dec (ðŸ§  Alzheimer's MRI Classifier)
An AI app built to detect alzeimers diseases using mri images.

This Streamlit web application allows users to upload an MRI brain scan and receive a predicted Alzheimer's diagnosis based on a fine-tuned *VGG16* deep learning model. It also visualizes the model's attention using *Grad-CAM* to help users understand the prediction.

## ðŸ§  Model Overview

This application uses a *VGG16* model pretrained on ImageNet, then fine-tuned on an Alzheimer's MRI dataset. The model learns to distinguish patterns in brain tissue that correspond to various dementia stages.

### ðŸŽ¯ Grad-CAM Visual Explanation

Grad-CAM (Selvaraju et al., 2017) highlights parts of the MRI that most influenced the modelâ€™s decision. Red regions indicate *strong activation* (high relevance), while blue shows *low attention*.
